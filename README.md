# Music-Data-Project

This project involved utilizing SQL queries to manipulate data in order to answer questions about the dataset.
I used MS SQL for this project that focused on answering 11 questions ranging from beginner friendly to advanced.
The purpose of this project was to get better at subquerying and using CTEs when presented with a lot of tables during data analysis. I was also able to practice developing ERD diagrams and finding relationships between tables using PKs and FKs.
